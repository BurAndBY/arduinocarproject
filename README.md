# arduinocarproject
This is app to control your Arduino Car (If you doesnt have Ultrasonic do not use Auto-pilot)! We have UltraSonic by JRodrigesTech,because Raspberry PI worked only UltraSonic by JRodrigoTech. You can try to use UltraSonic by Eric SimÃµes (But i think that this app is universal :) )
I was inspired by project of Vincenzo Scullino on ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryId=4747415622123520.
.ino file you will find on my helper's (OlegBURm) Github (This project will be named "ArduinoCarProject").
